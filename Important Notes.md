# IT-Y1-S2-ShortNotes

Some short notes I've created to study first year second semester modules :)
Most of the theory parts are taken from lecture notes and some from the internet.

Better to do all the past papers from 2017-present. Find all the past papers from SLIIT Digital Library :)

Here are some important notes that you better know before the exams / assignments,
